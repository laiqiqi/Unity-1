Vognition Project for Unity - Game Engine
=========================================

##What is Vognition?

Vognition is a platform as a service that provides natural language voice control APIs for smart devices that developers without speech expertise can use to create compelling voice-enabled applications.

##What can I do with this Unity project?

After importing the Vognition package, you can add a Vognition prefab object to your Scene. If the prefab is included in the scene, you can send a speech command to Vognition to get translated and then perform an action in the scene based on your command.

## Getting Started

1. Import Vognition package into your Unity Project.
2. Add Vognition prefab into your scene.
3. During testing, Hold "R" and say your command (Recording key can be set in Inspector. "R" is default.)
